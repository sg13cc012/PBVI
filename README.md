# PBVI
 
### Position Based Variant Identification (PBVI) is a method used to identify low-level variants by directly modeling sequencing error from a control dataset.
### This repository contains model files and scripts that can be used to detect low-level variants in 11 overgrowth syndrome genes. It also contains custom scripts used to assess sensitivity for this approach.
